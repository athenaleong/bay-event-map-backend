We aim to explore the intentional use of psychedelics in community from antiquity to the present. ‚ÄãInspired by Brian C. Muraresku's groundbreaking book The Immortality Key which shows evidence of LSD-like substances used in ancient Greece and early Christianity for mystical rites of passage, as well as in indigenous cultures (psilocybin mushrooms, Ayahuasca, peyote, Ibogaine, etc), this workshop will explore the value of using psychedelics in group settings for connecting us to deeper questions around the nature of existence. We will explore how such experiences can contribute to both individual and collective healing, foster meaning (in the sense of the philosopher John Vervaeke), and encourage spiritual growth by teaching skillful navigation of ego dissolution for spiritual insight. Our ultimate aim is to bring together like-minded explorers to begin a journey into the inner psyche, both individually and together.‚ÄãYour co-hosts are Nina (currently starting a project about the sociology of psychedelics inspired by her mentor Michael Pollan), Jacob Brawer (neuroscience of psychedelics at Stanford), Gabby White (dreamworker and interpreter of the collective unconscious), and Aaron Meyer (resident experienced psychonaut).

Disenchanted with hometown strip malls, sleaze bars, and rides along the river-side in her BMW. Impulsively she buys a discount airline ticket in a shopping mall travel agency. Destination: Vienna, the merry/sinister imperial city on the Danube. Gina Lee quickly slips into discreet, yet decadent dalliances at Cafe Central and at the notorious Hotel Orient, where she becomes embroiled in an intrigue to uncover buried Nazi plunder. Her liaison with rakish Karl Heinz Von Riegl builds to a furtive denouement at the Klimt Villa on the alpine shores of Lake Atter. Her fate remains unresolved - until we embark on the newly completed Parts II & III of the troika. The movie then reaches its fatal climax on the grand canal of Venice. This is a black & white filmic poem infused with metaphor and mood, where the past overtakes the present, and the present overtakes the past - now to be seen as one feature film of intrigue, compulsion, and enigma.",$15,https://www.4-star-movies.com/calendar-of-events/the-urania-trilogy-730-pm,

Over the last 7 years the Oakland band has developed an underground reputation for tackling the sublime with their ambitious songwriting, thunderous stage show, and acute lyricism. They have since emerged as an engine of the Bay Area‚Äôs revitalized psychedelic and festival scenes. Frontman Graham Patzner, who will crow like a medicine show preacher, and then coo you into the arms of his lovesick eternity, might be a spitfire protege of the underworld himself, though, through and through he will remind you that there is no rapture without artistry. On the surface this is splendid rock-and-roll, rooted in the classic, psych and glam rock tradition, but the pageantry and chaos of Whiskerman‚Äôs performances will leave you describing an experience more than a sound. The BAND: Graham Patzner (vocals, guitar, violin and piano), Will Lawrence (bass), and Charles Lloyd (guitar and sitar), Dan Schwartz (drums), and Jeremy Lyon (guitar).",Tip the Band,https://www.instagram.com/p/C38eLoLSaYV/?hl=en,

Through painting, sculpture, and black and white photography, this three person exhibition employs whimsy, conceptual rigor, and technical craft to explore the partnership between equine and equestrian. Horses are the most represented animal in prehistoric art. Well before their domestication, we revered them for their grace, strength, beauty and freedom. Carl Gustav Jung considered the horse as one of the archetypes of the mother as it carries its rider. In Celtic and Chinese mythology, they are viewed as a symbol of good luck. In Guinea, the horse‚Äôs tail was used as a peace offering to the Gods to secure a successful harvest. North American Indigenous tribes viewed them as ‚Äúspirit‚Äù brothers. Drawing from history, mythos and psychology, the artworks in Mane ‚Äòn Tail express the iconography of the horse not only as a beast of burden, but each animal as a beautiful sentient being with its own thoughts, fears and capacity to love; drawing parallels between two species with a fate that is eternally interwoven.",Free,https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Guq8jxBcx/,

Their dynamic arrangements, led by vocal, violin, vibraphone, synths, and percussion, are as introspective as they are retrospective.

04/11/2024,"Antimatter, Laetitia Sonami, Douglas McCausland, Heartworm",Music,8:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,San Francisco,"Peacock Lounge, 552 Haight Street","Antimatter What is the voltage of static electricity that courses over your skin standing each of five million hairs straight on end? Can the answer be derived quantitatively from the waveforms cascading against malleus, anvil and stapes to trigger follicle surge? Or is math itself lost in the abstraction to qualitative, perceptual, and metaphysical sense? Such shortcuts to madness are best explored through the complexities of minimal materialism, particles of sound as sculpted by Antimatter, the solo project of Xopher  Davidson.https://soundcloud.com/antiphonic-1 Laetitia Sonami Discovery narrows, contours deepen to become edges tipping your balance, opening a course below the beaten path. Tracing arabesques, Laetitia Sonami pilots a bathysphere of fantasmic depth extending her body to entwine, tentacular, across oceans of sound. ""In ancient times when we peered endlessly into hazy green screens flickering like glow worms, adding a bit of flesh was irresistible"" she recalls. As early as 1991, Sonami would ""leave some of the glamour behind"" in order to explore ""attractive weaknesses...the boundaries of expression, the pushback on one's intent."" Thirty years deep, a triangulated ring appeared in her work, the Spring Spyre, like an aperture in her chambered nautilus it reveals darkening depths still to be plumbed. When you find Sonami beginning her set inside the Peacock Lounge, don't bother taking a big breath first, there's plenty down there. https://vimeo.com/75110440 http://sonami.net/ Douglas McCausland Sounding a contrast of extremes using purpose-built interfaces, spatial audio, interactive systems, machine-learning, and hardware-hacking, McCausland finds sound where it first spawns, between nerve roots and bare metal. There's a difference between just burning down conventions and knowing how to build back better from scratch. In the process, organic and synthetic can meld anew, taking shape in real time and real life. McCausland jumped the wall at CCRMA to alight inside the new gleaming eyrie at SF Conservatory of Music teaching courses in the Technology and Applied Composition program. Be there when he swoops on the Peacock Lounge, then keep an eye on his work in the years to come at SFCM. https://ex-log.bandcamp.com/album/entanglement Heartworm Twenty-year veteran of subterranean music, Brandon Yahiro-Taylor, has recorded and performed in a dizzying array of styles, from freeform minimalism to harsh noise to breakcore to experimental metal to indie rock to ambient and musique concrete. On the east coast he founded the seminal net label slum.org before moving to San Francisco in 2003 where he became active with the 5lowershop soundsystem crew, organizing events throughout the bay area. https://soundcloud.com/heartworm","$5-15 sliding, NOTAFLOF, all-ages",https://www.facebook.com/events/936098767828683/,

05/26/2024,What's So Funny,Workshop,11:00:00 AM,3:00:00 PM,San Francisco,2400 Bayshore Blvd.,"Trying to be funny isn‚Äôt very funny. But oh my word is it funny to be authentic. The clown, above all, seeks to be one hundred percent purely, authentically (even overly and embarrassingly) committed to the truth in the moment. And hence, the ha-ha.In this clown workshop, explore how chasing beauty, depth and vulnerability on stage can lead to comedy on a level that hits harder than you could have ever imagined. Find the funny through the not-so-funny and be amazed by the hilarity in being exactly who you are.We will use writing and performance prompts and exercises designed to reveal and break down beliefs about what is and isn‚Äôt funny, what should and shouldn‚Äôt be shown on stage, and what is and isn‚Äôt the fourth wall. The clown doesn‚Äôt adhere to (or even understand) the societal constructs around us, so embodying our clowns gives us permission to dissolve made-up rules and connect with ourselves and the audience to find the ha-ha and boo-hoo in truly profound ways.A safe (but deep) dive into the parts we don‚Äôt want to show, where we can find the power of clowning, guided by Claire Woolner and John Norris (award-winning absurdist comedian/clowns who have earned their accolades by crying on stage so much that the audience laughs and bewildering the audience into fits of snorting hysteria, respectively.) There is no pressure to be, do or make anything funny and no prior clowning experience is required‚Äìwe will just explore the depths and see where they lead. But my gut tells me we‚Äôre gonna find some pretty absurdly hilarious shit. ",$125,https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/873414e6-fa39-4179-b416-77728a9ca524,

Balkancisco focuses on the idea that there are certain cultural expressions that are so innate to our shared humanity that they cannot be taken away by politics. When a young Turkish immigrant arrives in San Francisco, she finds herself inside an ever-growing Balkan music scene and sets off on a quest to explore how Bay Area has become such a hotbed for Balkan music, how it influenced the local music scene, and how music travels & transcends boundaries and borders. It's important to recognize the ways in which politics can divide us, but also to understand the enduring power of cultural expression and its ability to bring us together.",$13,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2024-sf-frozen-film-festival-music-documentary-balkancisco-tickets-940066463097,

What is climate in the arts right now? BURNING WILD is an original performance that combines song, movement, audio design, text, documentary video and more to explore a collaged docu-myth about the land, displacement, trauma, and renewal. Created in response to the California wildfires of 2020, it originally began as a community gathering circle to support Northern Californians affected by the wildfires. Recent 2020 fire survivors themselves, Deb√≥rah and Noor draw from their lived experience using personal stories of their relationship to home and placemaking from the Middle East to the Bay Area. In a time when a prolonged megafire season is an annual occurrence, Burning Wild offers an opportunity for resilience, hope and community healing. This is done by returning agency back to the audience and blurring performance distinctions such as dance, theater, audio design and song with social justice and cultural advocacy. BURNING WILD was selected to work in a week-long residency at the prestigious Summer Residency Lab, The Ground Floor: Berkeley Rep‚Äôs Center for the Creation and Development of New Work which brings artists to Berkeley to work on projects in 1‚Äì4 week residencies. All residency artists went through rigorous covid-testing and only worked outside. Creations include sculptures from burnt ephemera, poetry, dance and a site-specific ritual rounded out a week marked by the 1-year anniversary of the Walbridge Fire in Sonoma Co. https://www.avivaarts.org/burning-wild Burning Wild is both an indoor and outdoor experience. Please dress accordingly and wear comfortable walking shoes. If you have any mobility concerns, please let us know. Plan to spend 90-120 minutes with us. Please arrive at Dogpatch Hub at least 15 minutes early to check in and setup the audio experience on your phone. Dogpatch Hub has WiFi and restrooms available. The show will begin and end from here.From the Hub, you will be guided on a very short walk to Progress Park, where the audio drama and live performances will continue.

The exhibition includes public programs that examine time, ritual, memory keeping, and community-building practices between 2020 and 2024. The exhibition considers artists as prognosticators‚Äîforecasters of cultural shifts‚Äî and traces evolving artist practices and approaches as informed by activism‚Äîin particular, the creation of mutual aid networks spurred by lived experiences such as the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic, as well as the systemic inequities producing Black and Brown grief and the struggle towards liberation.

Join us for the opening reception at HIT Gallery on November 9th from 5-8. ""Coarse Men Talk Outside My Window"" draws on the sights and sounds observed and imagined while living in the Mission's Liberty Hill district.  ""An alleyway invites clandestine behavior,"" Katie once said, and this was true about San Carlos Street.  There were beautiful times and a warmth to the neighborhood, and other things which frightened me but were equally valuable in contributing to the richness and mystery of those years.  A woman crouched whispering in a hushed rage below my window in the middle of the night, a never-seen man sang in vibrato: ""Look into my eye-eye-eye"".  I never looked up whether this was an existing song or his own song.  While carrying groceries someone came from an alley and chased me most of the way home.  A man screamed ""MY NAME IS JOHN FITZPATRICK"" up and down the block.  The whispering was more concerning than the shouting.  The house I lived in had a super-size empty room that could be changed around easily to look different ways for filming.  The Leddy sisters across the street, Debbie Horn and her partner Paul, Hailey, Lars, Donovan, Jason, Josh, Anna Hillburg, Glenn, and Katie who I married.  All were lovely, funny, encouraging people whose voices greatly influenced my thoughts and creative work during those days and today.  I hope viewers find something to enjoy in this record of my experience of that period. ""Coarse Men Talk Outside My Window"" will be on display at HIT Gallery November 9-30th.",Free,https://www.hitgallerysf.com/,

With its evolving lineup and creative collaborations, the group brings fresh energy to traditional sounds.

01/01/2025,"Polar Plunge and World Naked Bike Ride-San Francisco, Plunge & Beach Party.",Meetup,10:30:00 AM,1:00:00 PM,San Francisco,"Ocean Beach, The Great Highway & Taraval, San Francisco, CA","Since 2011, the Riptide Bar on Taraval sponsored Polar Plunge that has drawn 400 or more people every year. It stands to reason several hundred will show up to plunge, whether or not the sponsors are there to host it. So let's do this. On New Years Day, starting at 10:30 am, begin gathering at the intersection of Taraval and the Great Highway. Beginning and ending at Taraval has worked out well and gives us two laps on the Great Highway, so this is where we will continue to meet for the New Years Day Polar Plunge World Naked Bike Ride. If it isn't raining, then we'll ride down to the Lincoln end of the Great Highway up to the Cliff House, turn around and head to Sloat by the zoo and back to Taraval. Then we will go down onto Ocean Beach to participate in the Polar Plunge. If the weather is good, we'll stay around afterwards for our Annual WNBR-SF New Years Day Beach Party. If it is raining; we'll plunge and we're done. In past years, many of us have headed up Taraval to some warm libations at the Riptide. It's a great place to meet new friends and introduce fellow plungers to the upcoming World Naked Bike Ride season. As always, nudity is optional; ride as bare as you dare.

01/02/2025,Birthing a New Year,Workshop,7:00:00 PM,8:30:00 PM,Oakland,"1948 9th Ave, Oakland, CA","Our whole life is an expression of who we are. How we dress, how we communicate, what we buy, how we decorate our home‚Äî all of it points to the values that we unknowingly or knowingly embody. This workshop is a space to recognize the parts of our expression that have been stifled‚Äî not speaking our truth to someone we love, not going for that job we want or not stepping onto our unique path although it continues to call us forward. Once we acknowledge these aspects we are able to process and move this stagnant energy so that we can get clear on how we aim to show up in 2025. What didn't you express in 2024? What is holding you back from the life you dream of? What have you been putting on the back burner that is ready to be felt so that you can clear its weight and find more space in your being to align to what lights you up for the new year? Join us, January 2nd as we come together as community to take a look behind us to acknowledge, express and release and in doing so, access the space within ourselves to take in the seeds of inspiration that surround us and birth a new year.This is a guided practice in an intimate and cozy container for those ready to get clear and pull their dream life a little closer to themselves, actualizing and manifesting your excitements by making more energetic space for them.Bring a notebook and something to write with, an open mind, and the desire to connect and crystalize your forward momentum in the direction of your choice. There will be journaling, connection, and a lightly guided movement practice. No experience necessary. About your facilitator: Bri is an embodiment and integration life coach, breathwork and meditation guide, community builder, ceremonialist and artist dedicated to supporting the realization of a more connected, compassionate and conscious world through community building, healing expression and the cultivation of a deeper sense of loving awareness toward self and others.

Marlo Winter and Luz Gaxiola created characters Richard Begaldix and George Lamps for an Antiques Roadshow themed aerial variety show in spring of 2021 where George juggled porcelain beaver figurines, Richard appraised them, and they fell in love.

If the ancients imagined their lives were seen by gods, recently we pose individually to an internalized technology, the social corporate-state as impassive witness. As server farms burn then rust, the self falters then finds itself once more face-to-face, in community. Join the performing audience tonight inside the Peacock Lounge to help realize ""Listen Like Lovers: The Pedagogy of the Surveilled"" a developing strategy in continuum with recent gatherings of Levantine and North African immigrants living in Amsterdam who developed a visual score that will be placed in your hands, to be interpreted in real-time with all the performers on tonight's bill, and you, the avant-garde as hope for a future able to behold it.TroglodistesLiz Allbee, Jason Stamberger, and Jake Rodriguez bear gifts of futures past, some assembly required because what's about to go down will be hard to believe unless you're inside the Peacock Lounge with them. Forged in the Bay Area underground back in 1996 when Stamberger (Crack W.A.R., Earwicker) and Allbee (Mute Socialite, Neung Phak) first performed together eventually forming the short-lived legendary band Le Flange du Mal. Then in 2003, the menacing mesomorph of Jake Rodriguez (bran(...)pos, Compomicro-Dexall) intersected their orbit which rocketed from house-show basements to mainstage theaters across decades and thousands of miles. This rare live session will be Allbee's only Bay Area show, occasioned by a visit from her home in Berlin. Since relocating, she has worked with George Lewis, Felix Kubin, Axel Dorner, Magda Mayas, and John Butcher so the labyrinth of her trumpet could be said to stretch all the way from there to golden age of Zeek Sheck, Hans Grusel, and Amber Asylum. If the past suggests the future, expect to hear superextended trumpet, plangent synthesizers, possibly a cello, tympani, or electric bass.

In Greek mythology, Hedone is personified as a goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight, as the daughter born from the union of Eros (personification of love) and Psyche (personification of the soul). She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure.What does it mean to embody your pleasure? To move without restraint and allow the divinity that you are to be expressed in the body that you were gifted? Can you let go of the ‚Äúself‚Äù you have created and trust the wisdom of your body, your movement, your soul? Can you allow yourself to both witness and be witnessed by others in their ecstasy? Can you meet the parts of yourself that stop you from expressing freely with compassion or at the very least with presence and curiosity? What does it even mean to move freely? Can you access that in this lifetime? Are you willing to try? Join us, as we gather on this Wolf Full Moon to experiment with tapping into the essence of the Divine Feminine; our freeform expression. This is a space for those curious about the natural movements that our bodies crave and serves as an invitation to open our channels to take in and release on deeper levels utilizing the art of dance, ceremony and energy of the full moon. meditation cushion, ect.)","$33 presale, $44 at the door ",https://plra.io/m/hedone?r=bri21847,

Audience participation and interaction is rarely focused on in clown training and this element of performance is so valued when well done. Oftentimes audience engagement is under rehearsed because it is hard to simulate. In this workshop we will explore techniques, methodology and practical skills of working with audience participants, creating interactive characters and creating effective gags, games and bits that use the audience as partners in your performance.Whether you are looking to bolster your strolling characters or get comfortable working with an audience participant in an act/show this introductory workshop will help in finding connection and laughter while working in the audience. Josh Matthews (They/He) is a teacher, actor, and clown/circus performer. He has traveled around the world with his theater company, Under the Table, performing original physical comedies. Josh Has performed at The Lincoln Center (NYC), The Big Apple Circus (NYC) and Third Rail Projects (NYC) to name a few companies. Josh has been a teaching artist and guest lecturer for the past 25 years, some of the organizations Josh has worked with have been the New Victory Theater, Word For Word theater company, American Conservatory Theater,  Occidental College, Sarah Lawrence College, and New York University.

Through long walks to site specific musical collaborations with dear friends including Danishta Rivero and Jacob Heule, Aaron Oppenheim and Kevin Robinson, they find possibility in intimacy. Sordahl wields cello and electronics while Lopez embraces all manner of sonic percussion. Together they unburden perception, breathing to transform and retune awareness and in the process subverting unexamined conventions, returning potency to music and conviviality to performance. TanukiSpiderCat Colleen Twitty's solo practice has as many fangs as bright yellow eyes, all of them fixin to sink into you. From crouch to pounce, TanukiSpiderCat's blizzard of tooth, claw, fluff, cello, modular synth, and meows nudges you along to your finale with lethal-swift soft paddycakes of pure desire.

02/26/2025,King Dream / Animal Prince / Ephemerald @ Ivy Room,Music,7:00:00 PM,1:00:00 AM,Berkeley,860 San Pablo Ave Albany CA,"KING DREAM is a Bay Area rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll band helmed by Oakland native Jeremy Lyon, a lifelong songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who crafts dive bar anthems with heart, brains and soul. Hard-rocking yet poignant, his music combines a love for American rock masters like Springsteen and Petty with ‚Äò60s West Coast psychedelia and more contemporary torch-bearers like My Morning Jacket and The War on Drugs ‚Äî all brought to life by a band of Northern California‚Äôs most in-demand players. ANIMAL PRINCE is the retro-pop project from singer-violinist Fae Nageon de Lestang and percussionist Grant McLeod. Fae‚Äôs vocals are a captivating instrument, drawing the listener into a landscape that‚Äôs playful yet polished, soulful but never self-serious, layered with string arrangements, synth grooves, hooks, harmonies and the occasional actual birdsong. Borrowing from bossa nova, fairy folk, yacht rock and chamber pop, Animal Prince would be at home on a mix with Caroline Polacheck, Emily King, or Feist, but the sound is uniquely their own: tender, danceable and delightfully feral.",15,https://www.ivyroom.com/#/events/128680,

The eponymous detective ghost-finder and occultist might have vanished in 1912 or... may yet stir in the limbs of Gregory Scharpen, Cheryl Leonard, Sheila Bosco, et alia. Is it so hard to believe Carnacki's ""Electric Pentacle"" or the Saaamaaa Ritual could be transposed to sound synthesizer or contact microphones. Wouldn't you be compelled to witness these sonic implements ""creaking in a mad vile glee"" ritualistically employed inside the Whistling Room...er, the Peacock Lounge? Get a front row seat, a garlic in each ear, then hold hands to form a circle, well... if you dare. https://thomascarnacki.bandcamp.com ‚Üµ Thomas Dimuzio: Dimuzio is the wizard the land of Oz wished for, boundless, benemalevolent, shrouded in torrents of sound, daring lions to speak and machines to weep.

Innovative techniques of sound synthesis, signal processing, algorithmic mixing and custom crossfade looping fuel this synergy of man and machine. https://gench.com/thomas-dimuzio ‚Üµ W.O.E.: Blending minimal techno, IDM, and noise, W.O.E. absorbs and reflects the shredded energies of our times via live performance.

Each time, with the help of those who are curious enough to step in, the community lands a little more, the ethos deepens, and we continue to break open ways that we are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to gather. Together, we co-create, hold space and witness something which seems to emerge amongst us: a group field which has a collective desire and intention but is created from truth which rings through each individual. This may be the most unique festival you have ever been to because what it is will be created by those who show up. We ebb between collective group field and intimate facilitated workshops like the expansion and contraction of the lungs of a living breathing organism. We listen to what is needed amongst the group and invite those willing and capable to take that space, offering your service to the community. You will have time to enjoy and experience new ways of expressing and connecting as well as be encouraged and supported to facilitate and hold space for your favorite ways to do just that. A festival everyone loves is possible because you will be creating it based on what it is you desire at the moment. And so will everyone else. ",Sliding scale $200-$400,https://lightingtheedge.com/,

Improvisational principles, concepts, and games give us THE VERY TOOLS we need to navigate the next chaotic, unplanned, or uncertain moment - on or off stage. This 3-hour workshop is intended for clowns, laypeople, actors, improvisers, curious humans and everyone and anyone else. You‚Äôll learn (or revisit) the fundamental principles of improvisation - including spontaneity, listening, storytelling, and failing cheerfully. You‚Äôll play games, do exercises, get some shared knowledge and get a sense of skills and tools that will be explored more deeply in a longer class series. This is a low pressure, low stakes class - being funny is not a prerequisite! Performance experience is not necessary! If you‚Äôve been curious about what the heck improv is or want to dip your proverbial toes in the improv pool, this is the class for you. Rebecca Poretsky has been improvising for over 20 years.  She was a company member and coach with the acclaimed BATS Improv for 10+ years, has taught improv at USF, performed with Crisis Hopkins, Un-Scripted Theater Co, and Awkward Dinner Party in SF and trained at BATS and at the Annoyance Theater in Chicago. Rebecca has trained in acting and clown at Shakespeare and Company in Lenox, MA and red nose clown with Giovanni Fusetti in Boulder. She‚Äôs developed and performed numerous solo performance pieces and co-created and participated in numerous original ensemble pieces. You can also find her in a bizarre number of semi-viral cat-themed videos online. She specializes in embodied, character, and narrative-driven scene work and improvisation. She loves helping people get out of their heads and into their bodies and remember that they know how to play. rebeccaporetsky.com",$100,https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/improv-101-workshop,

We will attack these ideas through exercises and group improvisations. Bring knee pads, a broken musical instrument or noisemaker, and your willingness to humiliate yourself in front of others. Eric Wilcox is a performance artist based in San Francisco. As a mime actor, Eric played countless wordless shows in schools and theaters around the world. In San Francisco with the street buffoon gang, SF Buffoons, Eric gleefully insulted thousands and created unique hybrid performances. In Germany he co-produced the MIME>BERLIN festival and summer mime intensive. His themes include; identity, memory, time, desire, and how to deprogram the body.

What does it mean to hold the space as the many, while uplifting the one? To channel inspiration as both vessel and voice? Through this mythic framework, we will train the ensemble to function as a living organism: responsive, intuitive, and alive to rhythm, design, and each other. Through structured improvisation, physical storytelling, and deep attention to musicality, tempo, line, and architecture, we‚Äôll learn to share our center‚Äîto partner not only with fellow performers, but with props, structures, and the unseen forces that shape story. This is a space for conjuring. For ensemble-driven magic. For surrendering individual ego in favor of collaborative impulse. Whether you‚Äôre a performer, director, or deviser, this intensive will challenge and refine your ability to generate dynamic, image-rich theater rooted in presence, myth, and shared vision.

Just as you can see contrasts in shape, color, and texture in an art piece‚Äîyou can smell those things too. This workshop, hosted by SLATE gallery, has been designed by olfactory artist Carmen Rose to illuminate the profound connection between scent and memory while teaching participants how to structure a perfume through hands-on experimentation with botanical ingredients. Through this process, students craft an ""olfactory portrait""‚Äîa unique personal scent that captures the essence of memories, places, or emotions that exist beyond the visual realm. Carmen provides worksheets and expert guidance throughout the blending process. The workshop takes place in dialogue with Oakland artist Hannah Franco's exhibition TRACES, which explores attention and value through visual narratives descended from women's craft and quilting traditions. Both artists work with the concept of capturing intangible experiences‚Äîand to bridge their artistic practices, Carmen Rose and Hannah Franco have collaborated on a custom scent that translates the ethos of Hannah‚Äôs artwork into fragrance. This signature scent‚Äîavailable for presale at the workshop only‚Äîoffers participants a tangible example of how visual art can be translated into an olfactory experience.

To be N√ú means to be √ú, to be so √ºnapologetically √ºrself, that is inspires others to as well. To be N√ú means to see the world not just as it is, but for what it could be, and to know that √ú have the power to make that change, so √ú must. We change the world, not just on our own, but by empowering others to believe that they can too. N√úRAVE is the ENERGY - that we get from music - that we get from coming together - & through this COLLECTIVE ENERGY, that‚Äôs how we create change, that‚Äôs how we make a movement, that‚Äôs how we inspire a revolution ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• We can‚Äôt wait to share this moment with √ú all. Together we are the N√úRAVE. See √ú there üôÇ",$23-33,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/closessions-dj-dials-presents-nurave-30-tickets-1461605664889,

""Too Much Information"" (TMI) refers to a colloquial expression used to convey the overwhelming feeling that arises when an individual is confronted with an excessive volume of data, details, or content, often to the point of becoming difficult to process or manage effectively. This concept is commonly used to highlight the challenges of navigating a world saturated with information, particularly in the digital age where data is readily accessible and constantly flowing.

Across each piece, textured monochromes hum with withheld emotion. Intimacy is rendered in restraint and memory pressed into form. Influenced by the emotional residue of past relationships and the threshold between identity and transformation, Hansen works with acrylic and burl woods‚Äîmaterials chosen for their organic resistance and subtle irregularity.  MIRRORS reflects Hansen‚Äôs personal processing of relational dynamics, exploring how others become surfaces onto which we project, distort, and rediscover ourselves. In tracing these blurred edges and elusive shadows, the work speaks to our shared human experience. Layered linework represents the complexity of connection, the tension between closeness and distance, and the quiet truths that emerge in reflection. Free to attend. Drinks available for purchase. Guests may also purchase tickets to our Sound Pour Event (Jazz and Wine tasting) taking place in our downstairs space that evening. Visit @thefaightsf on Instagram for more details.

He has a great relationship with his mom & sister, literally the most friendly person I know (can talk to anyone on the street), and cares for his friends really well! His person would also imagine having a commune with friends, rather than two people alone off the woods - someone who has explored their emotions deeply. Growing up Gabriel had a lot of struggles with money, queerness, religion (ask him abt his life story!!) but through each event he grows more whole. He would match really well with someone who has similarly thought very deeply about life. If you prioritize your career over everything else you might not be a good match.- you need to be cute (personality & personhood), tyvm. If he actually gets married from this event I get first dib on bridesmaid!!!! Gabriel is 28 and open to dating men aged 24-36. He wants kids. [1] Looking for PM and Project management roles.
