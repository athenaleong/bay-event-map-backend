      "description": "$5 Off Tix: Comedy Hit &#8220;Noises Off&#8221; Live in SF (Sept. 25-Nov. 8)\nJessica Palopoli\nNoises Off is a masterfully crafted comedy that takes you on a wild ride behind the scenes of a theatre company’s disastrous production of a farce called Nothing On. As the eccentric cast navigates forgotten lines, misplaced props, and personal feuds, their performances become increasingly chaotic, with doors slamming shut at the wrong moments, sardines going missing, and romantic entanglements causing tension. Featuring witty dialogue and side-splitting physical comedy, Noises Off is a must-see theatrical treat that has been called “the funniest farce ever written” (New York Post).\nNoises Off\nSan Francisco Playhouse\nSeptember 25 – November 8, 2025\n450 Post St., SF\nTickets starts at $47 $52&#8211; fees included\nExclusive – $5 off Tickets w/ secret code FUNCHEAP\nThe best seats go quickly. Tickets are subject to availability. \n“The most dexterously realized comedy ever about putting on a comedy. A spectacularly funny, peerless backstage farce. This dizzy, well-known romp is festival of delirium.” &#8211; The New York Times\n“Cry-your-eyes-out funny … Not just one of the funniest plays ever written but one of the best.” &#8211; Vulture\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSF Playhouse\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSF Playhouse\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSF Playhouse\t\t\n\t\nABOUT THE PLAYWRIGHT\nMICHAEL FRAYN was born in London in 1933.
